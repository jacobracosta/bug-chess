# bug-chess
A web app to play bug chess online.

TODO

-define game logic

-define bug movements

-come up with nomenclature for game moves,

  eg beetle1 to queen-0 (on top of queen)
  
  ant2 to hopper-4 (ant to the 4th hex of the grasshopper)
     
   (see shitty graphic below for proposed hex position names, 0th position would be on top)
     
       2. _
     
    1. /   \ 3.
      
    6. \    / 4.
      
         _ 5.
      
Design game loop

-start with commandline app

-commands like "place beetle, move ant, place queen"
